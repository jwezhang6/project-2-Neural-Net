# Project 2:Neural Net

Goal: Training and implementing a neural network to recognize hand written numbers

MINST Data Base - Database of handwritten numbers including a training set of 60000 numbers and test set of 10000 numbers.
We need a training set by which to allow the network to learn numbers and a test set to verify accuracy of neural network.

Part 1 - Finding and downloading MINST database composed of training and test files

Part 2 - Implement program to plot digits 

Part 3 - Create a neuron or the ouput of the internal activation function

Part 4 - 

Part 5 - 

Part 6 - 

Part 7 -

Part 8 -
