Goal: Implementation of neural network to recognize hand written numbers

MINST Data Base - Database of handwritten numbers including a training set of 60000 numbers and test set of 10000 numbers.
We need a training set of numbers by which to allow the network to learn numbers and a test set to verify accuracy of neural network
